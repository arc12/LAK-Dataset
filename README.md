# LAK-Dataset
Pre-processing and analysis on the LAK Dataset http://www.solaresearch.org/resources/lak-dataset/

This was originally used on the 2012 dataset and blogged about here:

Much has changed in the data-set since then so that is no longer usable as-is.

I am now working on a new project which will be making some simple use of the LAK Dataset, LAEP - https://laepanalytics.wordpress.com

I don't have the time to rework the old stuff and the aims of LAEP are different so I've simply created a separate folder for LAEP. The scripts there are written to work with the RDF dump available September 2015.
